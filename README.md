### Introduction

This project is designed to analyse the football matches played in German Bundesliga and English Premier League in 2011. However, this project was focused on the German teams playin gin this season. Data about each team's total goals, wins and losses can be found in this analysis. A table of winning percentage for teams that played on rainy days was also created. 

### Summary Methodology

With the use of Python's libraries such as: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib Pyplot, SQL, Sqlite3, Json, Requests and Pymongo it was possible to extract past data from a SQL database. From there, a table containing number of goals, total wins and losses for each team was built. 

This report is also comprised of data visualisation of wins and losses with the help of Matplotlib pyplot and Seaborn.

To find out about matches happening on rainy days in 2011, API from Dark Sky served as a source of extracting information for this purpose. The data can now be available in MongoDB.
